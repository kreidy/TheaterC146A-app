# Description
This is an app I made for UCLA's Theater C146A: The Art and Process of Entertainment Design. Our group project was an app inspired by escape rooms. Users would solve puzzles based on real-world locations, and the app would interact with the world via Bluetooth. Right now, it is a simple mock-up showcasing the potential design. I did all of the programming.

See the app_demo.mov file for a video of the app in action.
