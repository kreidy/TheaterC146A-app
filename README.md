# Description
This is an app I made for UCLA's Theater C146A: The Art and Process of Entertainment Design taught by Mk Haley. Our group project was an app inspired by escape rooms. Users would solve puzzles based on real-world locations, and the app would trigger interactions in the real world. Right now, it is a simple mock-up showcasing the potential design. I did all of the programming.
